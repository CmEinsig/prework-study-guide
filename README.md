# PreWork Study Guide 

## Description

The motivation behind the completeion of this project is to be bootcamp ready before the start of the first day of class. This solved the problem of not needing a physical notebook for class and instead I can use the study guide to add all of my notes. I learned how to code and use the github website to create projects!
