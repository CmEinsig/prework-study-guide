# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

I created this prework study guide website to get ready for our first day of classes in bootcamp. I built this project to display the necessary skills required before the first day of class. This project solves the utilization of new skills and displays a snapshot of the new content I learned about HTML, CSS Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This website can be used to help study information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can open the DevTools to see the JavaScript running. The JavaScript can help you study by choosing one topic to focus on at a time. There are notes in each heading box to help focus your studies.
